# REACT - Task Manager
Through this project I learned the basics of React.js as a powerful tool for building fast and snazzy frontend web applications. 
The main things that I learned from the project were;

- React Hooks - (UseEffect, UseState) -- The fundemental part of learning React.js is it's unique way of managing State.
- Functional and Class Based Components -- Throughout this exercise I was able to convert my previously class based components to functional components to reduce code, increase readability and conform with best practive 
- Basic CRUD functions on the front end
- Rendering HTML through JSX
- Basic architecture for organising code better for readibility, scalability etc..

Things I can improve on this app are;

- State Management
I would like to go further to understand and apply the context API as I found it hard when trying to access variables declared in sibling components

- ID Management 
There was not the attention when creating this app on assingning id's to each of the tasks in a way that would make getting a unique ID for each task very messy and complicated, this is what prevented connecting the NodeJS backend with a MySQL database instance. 
This in part, goes towards the initial mistake of not managing state as well as I should have from the start. 

- Code Design and Planning
As this was my first app using React.js and I am not as familiar with the syntax and implementation of managing State in the front end, there were a lot of things that I learned as I went by 

## How to run the app on your local
After cloning the repo to your local machinge, cd into the projecet directory folder and and runn npm -i, 
You should then be able to run the app by executing the following command. 
### `npm start`
This willl run the app in the local server in development mode.
Open the following URL's in your web browser [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to run the app.


To run tests on the app run, npm test
Proper ests have not been setup on this app, I would most likely implement Jest / Cypress scripts on this app, if I choose to refactor the code. 
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
